# Formula Parsing

Math formula evaluation using Shunting-Yard algorithm.

To make it work you have to:
- Install Qt 5
- Download the sources of boost (no need to build it), because it uses "boost::any". This app has been done with boost 1.56.0
- Create the environment variable called "BOOST_PATH" whose value is the path to boost sources
